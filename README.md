tictactoe-minimax
=================

A simple c++ implementation of Tic Tac Toe with the minimax algorithm.

Game uses a 2 x 2 array for the board and searches the full game tree for Tic Tac Toe (no pruning at this point).

g++ play.cpp game.cpp -o play  
./play

To do:
* In need of some cleanup and prettiness.
* Alpha/beta pruning
* Python web version!
